  abstract  = "In this article we discuss our experience designing and
               implementing a statistical computing language. In developing
               this new language, we sought to combine what we felt were useful
               features from two existing computer languages. We feel that the
               new language provides advantages in the areas of portability,
               computational efficiency, memory management, and scoping.",
