# Introduction

This is my first Rmd document.  I will demonstrate an inline
calculation to generate 3 random numbers: `r rnorm(3)` and then a code
chunk:

```{r,collapse=TRUE}
x = rnorm(500, mean=5, sd=2)
head(x)
mean(x)
sd(x)
```

And now we want to check that x is drawn from a Normal distribution

```{r, fig.height=4}
hist(x, prob=T)
abline(v=5, col='red')
curve(dnorm(x, mean=5, sd=2), add=T, col='blue')
```

# Summary

It works.
